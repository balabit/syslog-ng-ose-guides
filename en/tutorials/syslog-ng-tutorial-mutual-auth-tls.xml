    <para>Collecting log messages is an essential part of managing, maintaining, and troubleshooting IT systems. Since your log messages can contain all kinds of sensitive information, you should make sure that they are kept safe. The easiest way to protect the log messages as they are transferred from your clients to your logserver is to authenticate and encrypt the connection between the client and the server.</para>
    <para>This tutorial shows you step-by-step how to create the certificates required to authenticate your server and your clients, and how to configure &product; (&abbrev;) to send your log messages in an encrypted connection. Installing &abbrev; is not covered, <phrase condition="ose">but <link xmlns:ns1="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ns1:href="https://syslog-ng.org/3rd-party-binaries/">downloading it</link> for your platform and installing it should be easy</phrase><phrase condition="pe">for details, see <olink targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="chapter-install"/></phrase>.</para>

        <listitem>
            <para><xref linkend="mutual-authentication-certificates"/> describes how to create the required certificates to encrypt and authenticate the connection between your logserver and your clients. Actually, you can use this part of the tutorial even if you do not use &abbrev;, as it is independent from the logging application you use.</para>

        <title>Creating self-signed certificates</title>
        <para>TLS-encryption uses certificates to authenticate the server, and in case of mutual authentication, the client as well. The following sections show you how to create the required certificates.</para>
        <para>To use mutual authentication in &abbrev;, certificates are required. There are several commercial certificate authorities (CAs) who can help you, but the process costs both money and time (waiting until the submitted certificate is signed). This guide demonstrates how to create your very own Certificate Authority (CA) for creating self-signed certificates. It does not cover all the details, for example, changing expiration dates, only the minimally required steps to be able to use mutual authentication in &abbrev;.</para>
        <para>There are handy tools, such as CA.pl, which can make certificate creation and signing easier, but they are not available on all platforms, even if it is part of the OpenSSL software suite. On the other hand, the OpenSSL command line tool is available on all Linux distributions and BSD variants, so this tool will be used in the guide.</para>
