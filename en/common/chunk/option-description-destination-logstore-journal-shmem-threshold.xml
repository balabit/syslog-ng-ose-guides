<para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" version="5.0">If the memory required for the journal files exceeds the <parameter>logstore-journal-shmem-threshold()</parameter> limit, &abbrev; will store only a single journal block of every journal file in the memory, and &mdash; if more blocks are needed for a journal &mdash; store the additional blocks on the hard disk. Opening new logstore files means allocating memory for one new journal block for every new file. In extreme situations involving large traffic, this can lead to &abbrev; consuming the entire memory of the system. Adjust the <parameter>journal-block-size()</parameter> and your file-naming conventions as needed to avoid such situations.
