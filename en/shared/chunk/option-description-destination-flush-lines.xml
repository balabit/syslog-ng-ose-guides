    <para><emphasis role="bold">Description:</emphasis> Specifies how many lines are flushed to a destination at a time. The &abbrev; application waits for this number of lines to accumulate and sends them off in a single batch. Increasing this number increases throughput as more messages are sent in a single batch, but also increases message latency.</para>
    <para>The &abbrev; application flushes the messages if it has sent <parameter>flush-lines()</parameter> number of messages, or the queue became empty. If you stop or reload &abbrev; or in case of network sources, the connection with the client is closed, &abbrev; automatically sends the unsent messages to the destination.</para>
