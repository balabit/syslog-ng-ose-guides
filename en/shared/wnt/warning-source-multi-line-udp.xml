    <warning>
        <para>If you receive messages using the UDP protocol, do not use multi-line processing. If every line of a multi-line message is received in the same UDP packet, everything is fine, but if a multi-line message is fragmented into multiple UDP packets, the order they are received (thus the way how they are processed) cannot be guaranteed, and causes problems.</para>
