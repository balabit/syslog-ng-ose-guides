    <para>By default, the syslog-ng server will treat the relayed messages as if they were created by the relay host, not the host that originally sent them to the relay. In order to use the original hostname on the syslog-ng server, use the <userinput>keep-hostname(yes)</userinput> option both on the syslog-ng relay and the syslog-ng server. This option can be set individually for every source if needed.</para>
    <para>If you are relaying log messages and want to resolve IP addresses to hostnames, configure the first relay to do the name resolution.</para>
