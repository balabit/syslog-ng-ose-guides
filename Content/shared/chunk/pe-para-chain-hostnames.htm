    <body condition="pe" oldrole="p">The <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">chain-hostnames()</span> option of syslog-ng can interfere with the way <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> counts the log source hosts, causing syslog-ng to think there are more hosts logging to the central server, especially if the clients sends a hostname in the message that is different from its real hostname (as resolved from DNS). Disable the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">chain-hostnames()</span> option on your log sources to avoid any problems related to license counting.</body>
