        <h1>Section 7</h1>
        <p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
			Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
			facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
			library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
			the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
			permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>
                <p>Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
						based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
						facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
					Sections above.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
						that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
					where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
