        <h1>Section 0</h1>
        <p>This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
			program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
			other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
			this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
		Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
        <p>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
			prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
		(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>
        <p>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
			which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
			Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
			copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
			portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
			straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
		included without limitation in the term "modification".)</p>
        <p>
            "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
			making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
			all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
			interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
		and installation of the library.</p>
        <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
			covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
			running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
			such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
			on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
			writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
		and what the program that uses the Library does.</p>
