		<h1>Section 3</h1>
		<p>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
			License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
			this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
			that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
			instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
			ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
			that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
		these notices.</p>

		<p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
			that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
		subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>

		<p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
		the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
