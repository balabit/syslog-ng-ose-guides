        <h1>Section 6</h1>
        <p>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
			link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
			work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
			under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
			modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
		engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>
        <p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
			Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
			this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
			during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
			copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
			directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
			of these things:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>
                <p><a name="lgpl-2-6-a"></a>Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
						machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
						changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
						<MadCap:xref href="lgpl-2-1.htm"><span style="color: #04aada;" class="mcFormatColor">Section 1</span></MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="lgpl-2-2.htm"><span style="color: #04aada;" class="mcFormatColor">Section 2</span></MadCap:xref> above); and, if the work is an executable linked
						with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
						uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
						user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
						executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
						that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
						Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
					to use the modified definitions.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
						Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
						copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
						rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
						will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
						the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
					interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
						least three years, to give the same user the materials
						specified in <a href="#lgpl-2-6-a">Subsection 6a</a>, above, for a charge no more
					than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
						from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
					specified materials from the same place.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
					materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
			Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
			reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
			the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
			normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
			components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
			which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
		the executable.</p>
        <p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
			restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
			accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
			use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
		distribute.</p>
