        <p oldrole="para"><i oldrole="emphasis" role="bold">Description:</i> Specifies how many lines are flushed to a destination in one batch. The <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> application waits for this number of lines to accumulate and sends them off in a single batch. Increasing this number increases throughput as more messages are sent in a single batch, but also increases message latency.</p>
        <p oldrole="para">For example, if you set <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">batch-lines()</span> to 100, <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> waits for 100 messages. If the source sends a few messages, but less than 100 messages, <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> will not send the messages to the destination, unless you have also set the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">batch-timeout()</span> option (which is disabled by default).</p>
        <p oldrole="para">The <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> application flushes the messages if it has sent <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">batch-lines()</span> number of messages, or the queue became empty. If you stop or reload <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> or in case of network sources, the connection with the client is closed, <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> automatically sends the unsent messages to the destination.</p>
