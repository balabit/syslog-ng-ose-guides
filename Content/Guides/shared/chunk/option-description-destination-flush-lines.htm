The <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> application waits for this number of lines to accumulate and sends them off in a single batch. Increasing this number increases throughput as more messages are sent in a single batch, but also increases message latency.</p>

If you stop or reload <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> or in case of network sources, the connection with the client is closed, <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> automatically sends the unsent messages to the destination.</p>
