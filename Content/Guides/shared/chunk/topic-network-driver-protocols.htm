                <p>UDP is a simple datagram oriented protocol, which provides "best effort service" to transfer messages between hosts. It may lose messages, and no attempt is made to retransmit lost messages. The <i oldrole="emphasis"><a href="../../syslog-ng-guide-admin/chapters/concepts-message-bsdsyslog.htm">BSD-syslog</a></i> protocol traditionally uses UDP.</p>
                <p>Use UDP only if you have no other choice.</p>

                <p>TCP provides connection-oriented service: the client and the server establish a connection, each message is acknowledged, and lost packets are resent. TCP can detect lost connections, and messages are lost, only if the TCP connection breaks. When a TCP connection is broken, messages that the client has sent but were not yet received on the server are lost.</p>
