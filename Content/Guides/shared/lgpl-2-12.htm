			certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
			original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
			an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
			so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
			excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
		written in the body of this License.</p>
