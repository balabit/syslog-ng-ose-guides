        <h1>Section 11</h1>
        <p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
			infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
			conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
			otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
			excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
			distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
			License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
			may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
			license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
			all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
			the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
		refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>
        <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
			particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
		and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
        <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
			patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
			such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
			integrity of the free software distribution system which is
			implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
			generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
			through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
			system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
			to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
		impose that choice.</p>
        <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
		be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
