            <h6>Steps:</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Create an empty directory and navigate into that directory:</p>
                    <p><span class="Code" oldrole="command">mkdir CA</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="Code" oldrole="command">cd CA</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Create a few directories and give starting values to some support files:</p>
                    <p><span class="Code" oldrole="command">mkdir certs crl newcerts private</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="Code" oldrole="command">echo "01" &gt; serial</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="Code" oldrole="command">cp /dev/null index.txt</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Copy <span class="Code">openssl.conf</span> to the current directory. Depending on your distributions, the source directory might be different, so check the list of files in the OpenSSL package before copying:</p>
                    <p><span class="Code" oldrole="command">cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf openssl.cnf</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Edit <span class="Code">openssl.conf</span> in the current directory:</p>
                    <p><span class="Code" oldrole="command">vi openssl.cnf</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Search for the following part and replace <span class="Code">./DemoCA</span> with a single dot:</p><pre>[ CA_default ]

dir             = ./demoCA              # Where everything is kept
certs           = $dir/certs            # Where the issued certs are kept </pre>
                    <p>Change it to:</p><pre>[ CA_default ]

dir             = .                     # Where everything is kept
certs           = $dir/certs            # Where the issued certs are kept </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>As a last step, generate the certificate for the CA:</p>
                    <p><span class="Code" oldrole="command">openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout serverkey.pem -newkey rsa:4096 -out serverreq.pem -days 365 -config openssl.cnf</span>
                    </p>
                    <div class="Note">
                        <p class="Hyphenation"><span class="AllNoteStyles">NOTE:</span> By including and customizing the <span class="code">-newkey rsa:&lt;key size&gt;</span> element in your command line, you can set the key size that is compliant with your organization policy.  </p>

                    <p>The following will be displayed. Answer the questions as in the example:</p><pre>Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
