You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Getting request Private Key
Generating certificate request
example@linux-modi:~/CA&gt; openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -policy policy_anything -out servercert.pem -infiles tmp.pem
Using configuration from openssl.cnf
Enter pass phrase for ./private/cakey.pem:
Check that the request matches the signature
Signature ok
