<h1 name="syslog-ng-philosophy">The philosophy of syslog-ng</h1>
<p name="para-philosophy-intro" oldrole="para">Typically, syslog-ng is used to manage log messages and implement centralized logging, where the aim is to collect the log messages of several devices on a single, central log server. The different devices <MadCap:variable name="General.mdash"></MadCap:variable> called syslog-ng clients <MadCap:variable name="General.mdash"></MadCap:variable> all run syslog-ng, and collect the log messages from the various applications, files, and other <i oldrole="emphasis">sources</i>. The clients send all important log messages to the remote syslog-ng server, which sorts and stores them.</p>
