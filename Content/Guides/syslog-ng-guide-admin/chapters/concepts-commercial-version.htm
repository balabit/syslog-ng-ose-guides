        <h1 name="concepts-commercial-version">Commercial version of syslog-ng</h1>
        <p>The syslog-ng application has a commercial version available, called <MadCap:variable name="General.pe"></MadCap:variable> (<MadCap:variable name="General.peabbrev"></MadCap:variable>). The commercial version comes with well-tested features from its open source foundation, a number of extra features, enterprise-level support, as well as a ready-to-use log management appliance built on the strengths of <MadCap:variable name="General.pe"></MadCap:variable>.</p>
        <div><h6>Exclusive features related to compliance</h6>
        <p>Collecting and analyzing log messages is required directly or indirectly by several regulations, frameworks, and standards, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), the Health Insurance and Portability Act (HIPAA), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). <MadCap:variable name="General.peabbrev"></MadCap:variable> provides a set of features that help you comply with regulations that require the central collection of log messages in a tamperproof way:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Logstore files enable you to store log messages securely in encrypted, compressed and timestamped binary files. From a compliance point of view, this serves a double purpose. Encryption guarantees the integrity of log messages so you can be sure that they have not been manipulated. Timestamping provides verifiable proof about the exact time when log messages arrived.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <trademark>Reliable Log Transfer Protocol</trademark> (<trademark>RLTP</trademark>) is a proprietary transport protocol that prevents message loss during connection breaks. When using this protocol, the sender detects which messages the receiver has successfully received (based on the acknowledgments returned by the receiver after having processed messages). If messages are lost during transfer, the sender resends the missing messages, starting from the last successfully received message. Therefore, messages are not duplicated at the receiving end in case of a connection break.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></div>
        <div><h6>Wide range of supported platforms with binary installers</h6>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.pe"></MadCap:variable> comes with tested binary files that are available for a wide array of server platforms, reducing the time required for installation and maintenance. Support for a wide range of operating system and hardware platforms also make <MadCap:variable name="General.peabbrev"></MadCap:variable> an ideal choice to collect logs in massively heterogeneous environments.</p></div>
        <div><h6>Enterprise-level support services</h6>
        <p>As all commercial software, <MadCap:variable name="General.peabbrev"></MadCap:variable> also comes with various enterprise-level support packages, which means that you get immediate and pro-active assistance (24x7 if you choose a top-tier package), dedicated to resolving your issue as soon as possible when you experience problems.</p>
