        <p>The <span class="Code">host()</span>, <span class="Code">match()</span>, and <span class="Code">program()</span> filter functions and some other syslog-ng objects accept regular expressions as parameters. But evaluating general regular expressions puts a high load on the CPU, which can cause problems when the message traffic is very high. Often the regular expression can be replaced with simple filter functions and logical operators. Using simple filters and logical operators, the same effect can be achieved at a much lower CPU load.</p>
        <div class="Example">
            <h6>Example: Optimizing regular expressions in filters</h6>
            <p>Suppose you need a filter that matches the following error message logged by the <span class="Code">xntpd</span> NTP daemon:</p><pre>xntpd[1567]: time error -1159.777379 is too large (set clock manually);</pre>
            <p>The following filter uses regular expressions and matches every instance and variant of this message.</p><pre>filter f_demo_regexp {
    program("demo_program") and
    match("time error .* is too large .* set clock manually");
};</pre>
            <p>Segmenting the <span class="Code">match()</span> part of this filter into separate <span class="Code">match()</span> functions greatly improves the performance of the filter.</p><pre>filter f_demo_optimized_regexp {
    program("demo_program") and
    match("time error") and
    match("is too large") and
    match("set clock manually");
};</pre>
