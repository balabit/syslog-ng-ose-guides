        <p>Filters and substitution rewrite rules can use regular expressions. In regular expressions, the characters <span class="Code">()[].*?+^$|\</span> are used as special symbols. Depending on how you want to use these characters and which quotation mark you use, these characters must be used differently, as summarized below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Strings between single quotes (<span class="Code">'string'</span>) are treated literally and are not interpreted at all, you do not have to escape special characters. For example, the output of <span class="Code">'\x41'</span> is <span class="Code">\x41</span> (characters as follows: backslash, <span class="Code">x</span>(letter), <span class="Code">4</span>(number), <span class="Code">1</span>(number)). This makes writing and reading regular expressions much more simple: it is recommended to use single quotes when writing regular expressions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When enclosing strings between double-quotes (<span class="Code">"string"</span>), the string is interpreted and you have to escape special characters, that is, to precede them with a backslash (<span class="Code">\</span>) character if they are meant literally. for example, the output of the <span class="Code">"\x41"</span> is simply the letter <span class="Code">a</span>. Therefore special characters like <span class="Code">\</span>(backslash) or <span class="Code">"</span>(quotation mark) must be escaped (<span class="Code">\\</span> and <span class="Code">\"</span>). The following expressions are interpreted: <span class="Code">\a</span>, <span class="Code">\n</span>, <span class="Code">\r</span>, <span class="Code">\t</span>, <span class="Code">\v</span>. For example, the <span class="Code">\$40</span> expression matches the <span class="Code">$40</span> string. Backslashes have to be escaped as well if they are meant literally, for example, the <span class="Code">\\d</span> expression matches the <span class="Code">\d</span> string.</p>

					<span class="AllNoteStyles">TIP:</span> If you use single quotes, you do not need to escape the backslash, for example, <span class="Code">match("\\.")</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code">match('\.')</span>.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enclosing alphanumeric strings between double-quotes (<span class="Code">"string"</span>) is not necessary, you can just omit the double-quotes. for example, when writing filters, <b class="Code">match("sometext")</b> and <b class="Code">match(sometext)</b> will both match for the <span class="Code">sometext</span> string.</p>
               
				<div class="Note">
					<p class="Hyphenation"><span class="AllNoteStyles">NOTE:</span> Only strings containing alphanumerical characters can be used without quotes or double quotes. If the string contains whitespace or any special characters (<span class="Code">()[].*?+^$|\</span> or <span class="Code">;:#</span>), you must use quotes or double quotes.</p>
                    <p>When using the <span class="Code">;:#</span> characters, you must use quotes or double quotes, but escaping them is not required.</p>

        <p>By default, all regular expressions are case sensitive. To disable the case sensitivity of the expression, add the <b class="Code">flags(ignore-case)</b> option to the regular expression.</p><pre>filter demo_regexp_insensitive {
    host("system" flags(ignore-case));
};</pre>

        </div>
        <p>The regular expressions can use up to 255 regexp matches (<span class="Code">${1} ... ${255}</span>), but only from the last filter and only if the <span class="Code">flags("store-matches")</span> flag was set for the filter. For case-insensitive searches, use the <b class="Code">flags("ignore-case")</b> option.</p>
